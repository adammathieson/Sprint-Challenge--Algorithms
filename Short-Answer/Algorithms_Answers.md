#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)  The total time will increase at a greater rate than the size n.


b) O(n log n)  The total time will increase at an even greater rate than the size of n.


c) O(n) - Linear-  The time will depend on the size of n 

## Exercise II

Assuming that floor f is not known, and assuming the floor numbers are known as indexes,  I would :
-start from middle floor and drop an egg - if the egg breaks then move to the middle floor of the lower half of floors, else if the egg doesnâ€™t break -> middle point of the top half.
-Repeat this step until the difference in an egg breaking is the value of one floor height.

Runtime complexity of O(log n)
